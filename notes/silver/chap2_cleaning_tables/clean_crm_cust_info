--------------------Table--------------Clean & load crm_cust_info--------------------------------------

STEP 1: checks for NULLs or DUPLICATES in PRIMARY KEY
EXPECTATIONS: No results
-----------------------------------------------------

Explanation: we will remove NULLs & DUPLICATES while moving from bronze to silver
-- Query to analyse duplicates & NULLs
        SELECT cst_id,
        COUNT(*)
        FROM bronze.crm_cust_info
        GROUP BY cst_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 OR cst_id IS NULL;

-- analyse one by one DUPLICATE PRIMARY KEYs 
        SELECT *
        FROM bronze.crm_cust_info
        WHERE 
        cst_id = 29466;
Explaination: here we found that recods having different cst_create_date so we are only keeping latest date record
and removing old date record.

-- Query to identify duplicate record and filter only latest.
        SELECT * 
        FROM
        	(SELECT *,
        	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cst_id ORDER BY cst_create_date DESC) AS flag_last
        	FROM bronze.crm_cust_info
        	WHERE cst_id IS NOT NULL)t
        WHERE flag_last = 1;

Explaination: we have partitioned based on cst_id and order by based on cst_create_date and assigned row_number based on cst_create_date 
i.e. we have given rank to DUPLICATES and filetered only LATEST record

STEP 2: check for unwanted spaces
EXPECTATIONS: No results
-----------------------------------------------------
Explaination: check for columns like [cst_firstname], [cst_lastname], [cst_marital_status]

-- Query to identify if spaces presents for cst_firstname
        SELECT cst_firstname,
        LEN(cst_firstname) AS len1, -- this column just to see len differences
        LEN(TRIM(cst_firstname)) AS len2 -- this column just to see len differences
        FROM bronze.crm_cust_info
        WHERE cst_firstname != TRIM(cst_firstname);

-- Query to identify if spaces presents for cst_firstname
        SELECT cst_lastname,
        LEN(cst_lastname) AS len1, -- this column just to see len differences
        LEN(TRIM(cst_lastname)) AS len2 -- this column just to see len differences
        FROM bronze.crm_cust_info
        WHERE cst_lastname != TRIM(cst_lastname);

-- Query to identify if spaces presents for cst_gndr
        SELECT cst_gndr,
        LEN(cst_gndr) AS len1, -- this column just to see len differences
        LEN(TRIM(cst_gndr)) AS len2 -- this column just to see len differences
        FROM bronze.crm_cust_info
        WHERE cst_gndr != TRIM(cst_gndr);
Explaination: if the original alue is not equal to the same value after trimming, it means there are spaces

STEP 3: data standardization & consistency
EXPECTATIONS: In our datawarehouse, we aim to store clear & meaningful values rather than abbreviated terms
-----------------------------------------------------
Explainantion: check for [cst_gndr] & [cst_marital_status]

        SELECT DISTINCT
        cst_gndr
        FROM bronze.crm_cust_info
Explainantion: there are Three values in cst_gndr column NULL, M & F
so we: If 'F' then make it 'Female'
       If 'M' then make it 'Male'
       If NULL then make it 'n/a'
-- Query to make above requirements -- this query will work in MAIN QUERY
		CASE WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_gndr)) = 'M' THEN 'Male'
			 WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_gndr)) = 'F' THEN 'Female'
			 ELSE 'n/a'
		END cst_gndr,
Explainantion: also we ensure and take care of any space and lowercase

--  [cst_marital_status] --> M - Married & S - Single
		CASE WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_marital_status)) = 'M' THEN 'Married'
			 WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_marital_status)) = 'S' THEN 'Single'
			 ELSE 'n/a'
		END cst_marital_status,

STEP 3: nothing need to do with cst_create_date column
---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 4: inserting clean data into silver.crm_cust_info
-------------------------------------------------------
