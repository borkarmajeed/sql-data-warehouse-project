-- We will create STORED PROCEDURE 
then similar to bronze, add the following to the silver stored procedure:
1) Print messages for each section & step.
2) Implement error handling.
3) Print the duration of each step.
4) Print the duration of loading silver.


-- CONSISTENCY:
  If you introduce an improvement, like better logging or error handling, in one stored procedure, apply it to the others to maintain consistent standards & benefits.

-- to execute silver.load_silver stored procedure

      EXEC silver.load_silver
