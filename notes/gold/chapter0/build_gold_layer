  from source we gets raw unstructured data, data modelling is organizing this unstructured data into meaningful way

1) CONCEPTUAL DATA MODEL (Big picture)
2) LOGICAL DATA MODEL    (Blue print)
3) PHYSICAL DATA MODEL   (Implementation)


## START SCHEMA vs SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA
STAR SCHEMA     
--> fact table is surrounded by dimension tables
--> Simple & Easy
--> dimension gets bigger with time
  
SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA 
--> in snowflake, dimension tables are further divided into sub tables
--> more complex
--> large dataset can be managable by  dividing into sub tables

Note: read from chatgpt about when to use which

## FACT TABLES:
  Quantitative information that represents events
  e.g. Ids, dates, measrues & numbers these are columns in fact tables
