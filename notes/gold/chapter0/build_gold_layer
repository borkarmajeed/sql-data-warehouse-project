## GOLD LAYER

1) ANALYSING:
  Explore and understand the business objects

2) CODING:
  Data integration
    1) build the business obects
    2 choose the type FACT vs DIMENSION 
    3) rename to freindly names

3) VALIDATING:
  Data integration checks

4) DOCS & VERSION
  Documenting versioning in GIT (data model, data flow, data catalog)

## WHAT IS DATA MODELLING??
  from source we gets raw unstructured data, data modelling is organizing this unstructured data into meaningful way
  example, sagregatng customer, products, orders data etc.

  -- there are three different stages/ways of how to draw a data model.

1) CONCEPTUAL DATA MODEL (Big picture)
2) LOGICAL DATA MODEL    (Blue print)
3) PHYSICAL DATA MODEL   (Implementation)

In our projects we are working with 1) CONCEPTUAL DATA MODEL (Big picture) 2) LOGICAL DATA MODEL    (Blue print), As
3) PHYSICAL DATA MODEL   (Implementation) needs alot of eforts & time, tools like databricks auuto build this data model


## START SCHEMA vs SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA
STAR SCHEMA     
--> fact table is surrounded by dimension tables
--> Simple & Easy
--> dimension gets bigger with time
  
SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA 
--> in snowflake, dimension tables are further divided into sub tables
--> more complex
--> large dataset can be managable by  dividing into sub tables, it helps to optimized storage

Note: read from chatgpt about when to use which

## FACT TABLES:
  Quantitative information that represents events
  e.g. Ids, dates, measrues & numbers these are columns in fact tables
  --> how much ? & How many ? like details found in any table then it is

## DIMENSION TABLES
  Descriptive information that give context to your data.
  e.g. category, subcategory
  --> who? what? where? then 

## INTEGRATION MODEL
  here we identified that data is related to customers, orders & sales so as per that we marked the tables related to customers, orders & sales
  so that we will combine our related tables and make further fact & dimension tables for business

## Explore the business objects: by making data inetgration model we explored about business objects like they want to analyse customres, sales & orders

## read the Gold layer architecture design, as we want to make reportingand analytics ready data, only veiws, no load, business rules, building star schema etc. (03:38 - 03:40 min.)
